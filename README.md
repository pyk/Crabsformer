# np
`np` is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Rust.
It contains among other things:

- a powerful N-dimensional array routines
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, `np` can also be used as an efficient
multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined.
This allows `np` to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety
of databases.

`np` is licensed under the [BSD 3-Clause](https://github.com/pyk/np/blob/master/LICENSE)
